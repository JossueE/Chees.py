# Chees.py
This program allows users to play chess by interacting with a graphical user interface. The code handles various aspects of the game, including board visualization, piece movement, and user input processing. Let's explore the main features and functionalities of this chess program. This program was carried out in collaboration with a team and the support of our teacher. I was in charge of implementing PyGame for the visualization of the game, the images used are free to use and I also collaborated in the development of the movement of the tower.
